This is an example script for the RLadies meetup.

We will compare results created by the `DESeq2` R package and its Python implementation `pydeseq2`.

Some technicalities:
- `git clone git@github.com:zkuralt/r-n-py.git` will teleport this folder to your computer.
- Running renv::restore() will install all the R packages needed.

You should now be able to run the *example.Rmd* script without problems :)
