This is an example script for the RLadies meetup.

We will compare results created by the [`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) R package and its Python implementation [`pydeseq2`](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Some technicalities:
- `git clone git@github.com:zkuralt/r-n-py.git` will teleport this folder to your computer.
- Running renv::restore() will install all the R packages needed.

See [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) docs for a lot more information ;)

You should now be able to run the *example.Rmd* script without problems :)

Update:
Well, as usual, things did not go as smoothly as one would have wanted.
- Windows users had problems installing packages via `renv::restore()`, but manually installing packages mostly did the trick.
- Mac user had to explicitly set Python interpreter in the RStudio settings (Tools - Global options - Python).
- Linux user had no issues whatsoever :)
